Welcome to the installation instructions for the Big Blue Button polling module!

If you are installing the polling module onto a development environment, simply run scripts/install-polling-module-dev.sh and follow the onscreen prompts.

If you are installing the polling module onto a NON-DEVELOPMENT environment, PLEASE 
BE ADVISED that any custom locale changes you have made will be overwritten by the 
installation. To install:
  - Back up any custome locale changes you have made
  - Run scripts/install-polling-module.sh


(NOTE: Ensure you have execute permission for the script you plan to run.)

DEVELOPMENT INSTALL:
This will edit your config.xml and build.xml files, modify Images.as to use the 
Polling icon, set up web polling, append polling-related localization strings to 
your locale files, graft the polling module file structure onto your development 
environment, and finally compile the module.

Compiling the module can be a lengthy process, due to the need to build locales, 
the client, and the apps. There is a chance that during the build process for 
locales or client that Java may throw a runtime error; the script is built to take 
care of this.

NON-DEVELOPMENT INSTALL:
This will migrate .swf and .class files necessary for the polling module into your 
BigBlueButton installation, and modify config.xml and bbb-apps.xml. It will not take 
very long.
