Welcome to the installation instructions for the Big Blue Button polling module!
These instructions assume that you already have a BigBlueButton development 
environment in place on your server.

Installation is very simple, there is only one step:

- Navigate into the Scripts folder and run install-polling-module.sh. 

(NOTE: Ensure you have execute permission for install-polling-module.sh.)

This will edit your config.xml and build.xml files, modify Images.as to use the 
Polling icon, set up web polling, append polling-related localization strings to 
your locale files, graft the polling module file structure onto your development 
environment, and finally compile the module.

Compiling the module will be a lengthy process, due to the need to build locales, 
the client, and the apps. There is a chance that during the build process for 
locales or client that Java may throw a runtime error; the script is built to take 
care of this.
